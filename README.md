# simple-react-webpack

This is a barebones boilerplate that works for me when initializing small projects.

# Tools
* React
* Webpack
..* including a small Express dev server
* ES6 (transpiled with Babel)
* Sass
* Hot-reloading

# Usage
```
> git clone https://github.com/AndrewTHuang/simple-react-webpack.git
> npm install
> npm start
```

There you go! You're up and running at ```localhost:3000```
