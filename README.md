# simple-react-webpack

This is a barebones boilerplate that works for me when initializing small projects.

## Tools
* React
* Webpack
  * including a small Express dev server
* Babel (to transpile ES6)
* SASS
* Testing
  * Karma
  * Mocha + Chai
  * [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
  * PhantomJS
* Hot-reloading

## Usage
```
> git clone https://github.com/AndrewTHuang/simple-react-webpack.git
> cd simple-react-webpack
> npm install
> npm start
```

There you go! You're up and running at ```localhost:3000```

## Testing
```
> npm test
```
